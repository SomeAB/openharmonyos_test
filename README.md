This is attempt to build from source Open Harmony OS 5.1 Standard. 

Primary Goal: Successfully build Open Harmony 5.1

Additional Goals: GUI interaction, Further Exploration

- We are using additional technologies like docker, docker-compose, qemu, novnc, etc to help get an GUI running as well. 
- In the docker_old folder, there is a old docker file, that follows the official tutorial closely, but it is outdated version 3.2 (from year 2023). Its just there for additional reference
- The source code links were taken from here: https://docs.openharmony.cn/pages/v5.1/en/release-notes/OpenHarmony-v5.1.0-release.md
- The outdated docker tutorial exist here: https://docs.openharmony.cn/pages/v5.1/en/device-dev/get-code/gettools-acquire.md
- Since we got networking issues before, so getting source files from gitee, we are using the officially provided tar archive

Feel free to open an issue to suggest refinements, ideas, etc.
