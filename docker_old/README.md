# Docker (Old)

This folder contains the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml that follow the outdated Docker tutorial from the OpenHarmony documentation (year 2023).

```
 **Note:**
 - This setup is intended for compiling OpenHarmony 3.2 only.
 - For current builds or newer OpenHarmony versions, use the updated Docker setup in the main `docker` folder.
```
