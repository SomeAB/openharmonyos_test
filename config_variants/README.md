# Config Variants

This folder contains configuration files for OpenHarmony builds.

- [`default_config.json`](./default_config.json): This is the json file as it exists in 'OpenHarmony 5.1 Release' source code. This is only here for reference, and should not be modified.

- [`config.json`](./config.json): This is the working configuration variant. Modify this file to apply changes for your custom OpenHarmony builds. It is used for file replacement and patching scenarios.
