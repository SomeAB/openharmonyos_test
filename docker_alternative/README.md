## Docker (Alternative) - Placeholder/Work In Progress

This folder contains the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml that follows an alternative setup based on OpenHarmony Education Distro


 **Note:**
 - This setup uses the 3.2 docker image somehow with OpenHarmony 5.0.x 
 - For current builds or newer OpenHarmony versions, use the updated Docker setup in the main `docker` folder.
 - More details are available on the [OpenHarmony Education Distro Gitee Repo](https://openharmony-education.github.io/openharmony-education-distro/)
